## 4 Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Encapsulation. Wrap code in good interfaces. Hide private data, expose publicly accessible methods.
- Abstraction. Abstract general ideas that work for many, e.g. move is an abstraction of crawl, slither, fly.
- Inheritance. Write once in a parent class and all the derived child classes get it for free.
- Polymorphism. "Many shapes". One thing (e.g. move) can take many forms, e.g. a snake might move by slithering, while a bird might move by flying.
